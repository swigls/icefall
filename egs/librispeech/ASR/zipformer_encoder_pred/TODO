### TODO list
! Theory is never wrong. 
    => What I have to do is, just believe this and go forward experiments
! H(t,u) is learned on training set, and also evaluated at the same set.
    => Is it reasonable? (Hmm...)
    => If it's reasonable, don't let the model overfit to the data. (IMPORTANT!)
* train.sh
    +++ larger prune-range (10? 20?)
* encoder_pred.py
* model.py
    +++ apply py_add also to simple loss calculation? (seems not very necessary)
