### TODO list
! Theory is never wrong. 
    => What I have to do is, just believe this and go forward experiments
* train.sh
* encoder_pred.py
    + More expressive H family
        + Gaussian with stddev learnable?
        + Normalizing flow
    + More expressive NN
        * Full conv rather than 
    + Faster optimizable NN
        + Fastly adapt to changing h_t
* model.py
    + apply py_add also to simple loss calculation? (seems not very necessary)

Questions
* Why pred norm is always smaller than target norm? Its weird.
