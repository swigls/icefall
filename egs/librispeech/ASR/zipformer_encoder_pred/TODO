### TODO list
* train.sh
* encoder_pred.py
    * Biggest problem: Why y_1:u not helpful for predicting h_t+1 given h_1:t?
    + Gaussian with stddev learnable?
* model.py
    + apply py_add also to simple loss calculation? (seems not very necessary)

Questions
* Why decode scale is much larger (logp_scale should be much smaller)?
* Is code for encoder_prediction / l2_loss / logp_ratio all right?
